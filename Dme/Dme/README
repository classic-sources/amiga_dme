First Time DME users:
    READ THE DOCUMENTATION.  There is no online help for DME.  The
    editor is designed for programmers like me.  However, the
    distributed .edrc does set up some primitive menus to help first
    timers learn some of the more useful keymaps.

Seasoned DME users:
    The end of the documentation contains changes and bug fixes to
    this version.  Review the command list.
