    HELP key enforcer hit.

    ARexx support, arexx scripts can make DME commands

    point-drag approach to blocks

    BUG:    null: not mounted, try to execute, cancel... CRASH

    BUG:    change from 80->60 with DME up then iconify... CRASH


Last Revision 3 November 1989,	Matthew Dillon

    3 Nov 1989:
	Incorporate UNDO code

    5 July 1989:

	record mode

    19 June 1989:
	char block functions
	replace query
	find-replace cursor problem
	hands on examples for CTAGS and REFS
	add flag for 'line under cursor is empty'

	pal config?


    ---


	  3 December 1988: read-only mode.
	-31 October 1988:  Restore permission bits on write (if overwrite)
			    & assoc. commands
	-31 October 1988:  Save while iconified, fix window colors




	-SAVEMAP, does not output (s- ) properly.

BUGS:
	- Word Wrap (actually reformat).  hold 1 down ... can freeze up due
	  to word being too long.
	- Can get behind keyboard when key repeating.
	- Fix case-ignore

TODO:
	- wordwrap mode reformat should put two spaces after punctuation
	  .?!:; instead of 1.
	- ascii numeric variable support and ENV: support
	- Gerhard's stuff
	- exception handling
	- string kill vector
	- character oriented blocks
	- stackable search/replace strings
	- a way to cancel all user keymaps
	- clipboard support
	- anchored search
	- provision to show mapping for a single key.  Allow $map .. $c-a...
	- Allow different current directory for each window
	- Add scroll gadgets
	- Formatted Save


fsave (formatted save)

    When it encounters one linefeed with the next character not whitespace,
    it writes a space.	If the next character is whitespace it leaves it
    alone (write one linefeed).  If the next character is a linefeed, write
    one linefeed then copy linefeeds up to the next non-linefeed.

    This will almost allow "word-processor" output... with columns! Very
    simple, very small, and it will save me from the horrors of
    PageSetter's editor.  You may want to do funky things to the name like
    "fsaveas" or "fbsave" or whatever.


SUGGESTIONS FOR NOT SO IMMEDIATE FUTURE:

   Add some user-accessible variables, like for current x/y position,
total text length, insert mode, modification status, window size and
position, current line length, last operation status, etc.

   Add an array of user integer variables to go along with the array
of toggles.

   Add a command to evaluate simple arithmetic expressions and store
the result in user variables.

   Teach the condition evaluator (for "if" and "when") to do comparisons
on integers and maybe also on strings ("if $scanf=`something'" ?).

   Have you considered porting the guts of DME into a machine-independent
environment (curses?).  I know, this is pretty far fetched, it's just that
I miss the power of DME at work...
