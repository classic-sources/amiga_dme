				    VI
			      REVISION SUMMARY

V1.45
    - menu code updated BIX:dhack
    - iconify code updated BIX:fgk

V1.44
    - workbench problems all fixed! (I HOPE!)

V1.43
    - refs command fixed yet again

V1.42
    - keyboard macro routines accept foreign characters (> ascii code 127)
    - bug fix to $variable stuff when 'variable' does not exist
    - bug fix to split
    - bug fix to join
    - COL command enhanced (now w/ +col and -col for relative movement)
    - new special vars: $margin, $modified, $currentline
    - new commands UNDELINE, MODIFIED, JUSTIFY, UNJUSTIFY, TITLE
    - cosmetic changes to arp requester

V1.41 HOPEFULLY STABLE
    - Recompiled with fixes and new DICE version

V1.40 GAMMA INTERMEDIATE
    - No longer configurable with 'config' program.  Now saves window
      dimensions, color selection, and most window modes (insert, margin,
      etc...) to S:dme.config, restoring automatically when any new
      window is brought up.

    - Can no longer specify window dimensions on command line or via
      workbench, sorry!

    - New commands: SAVECONFIG FGPEN BGPEN HGPEN

    - Fixed bug in ARP requester ... wasn't saving D2/D3/A6.  Also fixed
      but in Lattice asm... apparently if the __MERGED section in afilereq.asm
      is first lattice asm generates a 0 byte bss section OOPS!

    - This is an Experimental intermediate version
      (executable compiled w/ my compiler and may not compile cleanly under
       Lattice or Aztec)

V????
    - didn't restore pr_ConsoleDevice after an execute!

V1.39
    - NEW COMMAND, 'setparcol'.  Set paragraph left margin for reformat
      command and word wrap mode.  The default is -1 (same as original
      format), else a column number.

    - case sensitive bug fixed.. used to always be case insensitive
      no matter which option you chose.

    - search-and-replace bug fixed... cursor positioned to END of
      replaced string to prevent improper operation when replace
      string is a superset of the search string.

    - Menus more compact.

V1.38
    - Removed fix in 1.37, use '1.4libpatch' if running under 1.4A16.

    - FIXED AREXX BUG... DMe would crash if ARexx was installed for
      V's 1.37 and 1.36

V1.37
    - 1.4a16 crashes on OpenLibrary() where the library does not
      exist.  Doesn't try to open arex if running under 1.4
      (for now, this is a temporary stopgap)

V1.36
    -Removed dres.library IPC.	Removed dres.library requirement.  (ARexx IPC
     still in of course).  Source now compilable under Lattice C and Manx C.

V1.35a
    -can change block pen now and DME updates the title using the correct
     color.

V1.35
    -Bug in 1.34 fixed, would only work if dres.library was installed
	OOOPPS.

V1.34
    -New variables $fpath and $fname have been added.  $fpath is the path
     part of the current filename, including trailing / or : (if any).
     $fname is anything after that.  For example:

	FILE		fpath	    fname
	s:.edrc 	s:	     .edrc
	blah			     blah	 (path = "")
	/poof		/	     poof


V1.33	RELEASE
    -You can now run <nil: >nil: DME and close the console window that
     you ran it from.  The execute command now requires the NULL: device
     to be mounted or an error will occur.

    -space -> tab conversion does not take place after the first control
     character (<32), as well as the first quote ("), open paren ((), or
     single quote (') that it didn't before.

V1.32		    (small fixes)
    -Fixed workbench bugs, DME would exit if it could not find the
     executables disk object.  No longer does so.

V1.31	RELEASE
    -Added new variables $lineno and $colno
    -Added CD command, ARPLOAD automatically CD's to DIR part of
     requester.
    -Added IPC support (my own ipc)
    -Fixed bug in BMOVE (when the source block is an entire file)

V1.30C	LIMITED
    -MAJOR!	Macros, Internal variables, and ENV: enviroment variables
		may be specified with $varname, $(varname), or $`varname'.

    -New commands:  SET, SETENV, UNSET, UNSETENV    (variable support)

    -REFS window bug fixed I hope (made window slightly too small).
    -SAVE[S]MAP bug fixed for space mappings
    -CTAGS doesn't modify the window title if the window is iconified
     (allows you to make the following map: map <somemap> (iconify ctags)


V1.30B	Limited release
    -Kim fixed a bug in splitpath
    -added CTAGS command... support for Aztec's CTAGS program
    -added ADDPATH command... special directory paths for DME
    -added REMPATH

	REFS no longer searches fixed directories, but looks at the
	ADDPATH directories.  CTAGS also looks at the ADDPATH
	directories.  CTAGS supports arbitrary directory specifications
	and is intelligent about where to look for the TAGS file.


V1.30	RELEASE
    -a couple small bugs fixed
    -fixed text bug that sometimes overwrites the right border
    -added new commands
	SETFONT     (for all of text, static fonts only)
	IGNORECASE  (for searches)
    -added new commands (AREXX support, Kim DeVaughn)
	RX, RX1, RX2
    -added new commands (by Kevin Speghetti)
	PUSHMARK, POPMARK, SWAPMARK, PURGEMARK	    block marker stack
	PING, PONG				    text markers (0-9)

	note: block marks on the stack, ping and pong, do not track text
	changes (bug).

    -Many commands will now work while the text window is iconified
     without having to uniconify it.

V1.29E
    -Fixed low memory bug in do_bomve() again.
    -Fixed arp file requestor problems.
    -added ARPINSFILE command.
V1.29D
    -Fixed low memory bug in do_bmove()...
V1.29C
    -highlighted icon window if file modified
V1.29B
    -INLINE FILENAME:
     added $filename variable.	$scanf and $filename can now be embedded
     anywhere on the command line.
    - ^x added (control-character), so you do not have to embed actual
     control characters in your macros.
    - \ overide added (\^x) produces "^x" instead of control-x, etc...

V1.29  RELEASE

    -Foreign keyboards supported better.
    -Iconify window is activated rather than not activated.
    -can keymap keys which normally produce nothing.
    -blocks are displayed in a different color
    -can now move/copy across windows
    -can now resize window while file loading
    -new commands ARPLOAD ARPSAVE   (uses ARP filerequestor if arp.library)
     MENUADD MENUDEL MENUDELHDR MENUCLEAR MENUOFF MENUON

    minor bugs fixed, major remodeling of the source (this is what I
    use my vacation for!)

    menus:  the right mouse button may be mapped only if there is no
    menu, Else is used as the menu selector.  NOTE! It is much faster
    to surround a set of MENUADD commands in a source file with
    MENUOFF at the beginning and MENUON at the end.  You can also specify
    menu items as macros in other commands (example: project-save)

V1.28h SMALL RELEASE	references work better

V1.28g SMALL RELEASE	Fixed NK0 bug in 1.28f plus keymap problems in 1.28f

V1.28f RELEASE
    Fixed macro bug created in 1.28e... could not specify macros on the
    command line.

V1.28e INTERNAL/BETA
    New Commands:   REF     (c-])   -cross reference the word under the
				     cursor and bring up a new window
				     containing a description for that
				     word.  See docs above.

    -The keymapping has been fixed and should now work on any foreign
     keyboard.
    -MAJOR ADDITION:  () may be used instead of `' to enclose commands.
     One can enclose the other ... that is, to get the "'" character you
     can say (this is a charlie's day).

V1.28c RELEASE
    New Commands:   CHFILENAME	    -change default filename for a window
		    RECALL  (c-esc) -recall command line (e.g. you make a
				     mistake).	Must be used from a keymap,
				     default is c-esc.

		    SCANF	    -C scanf (single string only).  Extract
				     strings from the text for use in any
				     arbitrary command.

    Command Parser: $scanf	    -as an argument by itself is recognized
				     to be the extracted string from scanf.
				     Currently, the variable name (after
				     the dollar) can be anything since only
				     one variable exists, but use '$scanf'
				     for future compatibility.

    -Many Bug fixes (mainly benign bugs)
    -^C (CONTROL C) now recognized when typed in a window.  c-c is mapped
     to () = no action.
    -Please look at the revised default keymappings listed in these docs.
